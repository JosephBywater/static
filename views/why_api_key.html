<h4>Why do I need an API key?</h4>
<p>It was a tough decision to make, but in May 2016 we decided to require an API key for proper access to our APIs.</p>
<p>We had to do this for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul class="inline">
    <li>To ease communication between us and you.</li>
    <li>To allow us to tailor the API to your needs.</li>
    <li>To make it easier to block malicious users.</li>
    <li>To ensure fair use of the API.</li>
</ul>

<h5 class="bold">How can I get an API key?</h5>
{{#user.authed}}
<p>To view or re-generate your API key <a href="/manage">click here</a>.</p>
{{/user.authed}}
{{^user.authed}}
<p>It is very simple, click the <a href="/manage">Account</a> button in the navigation bar and follow the instructions to login with Twitter.</p>

<h5 class="bold">Am I rate limited for cached responses?</h5>
<p>If our servers have a response for your request cached then no, it will not be rate limited nor will you require an API key.</p>
<p>In other words: If you are asking for something that is cached you don't need an API key and rate limits don't apply!</p>
<p class="text-muted">This may seem silly, but there are some niche use cases for this functionality, it also speeds up cached responses.</p>

<h5 class="bold">Why do I need to login with Twitter?</h5>
<p style="margin-bottom:0">We use Twitter to handle authentication, this allows you to have all of the security features built in to Twitter (such as two-factor authentication) as well as the convenience of not needing a username/password for another site.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:.3em;margin-top:.3em">We <strong>cannot</strong> post tweets, access your direct messages or other private information.</p>
